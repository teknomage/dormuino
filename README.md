# OpenSleep

The development of the hardware and software for this system started and most of it was done during my first semester at the Fluid Interfaces Group of the MIT Media Lab. This technology was used for many projects, [Dormio](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/sleep-creativity/overview/) being the most notable. This project is part of a larger iniatiative called Engineering Dreams, which seeks to build technology that interfaces with the sleeping mind.

[Adam Horowitz](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/adamjhh/overview/) led the experiment design and execution to validate the system, [Oscar Rosello](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/rosello/overview/) the interaction and form factor, and  [Eyal Perry](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/eyalp/overview/) the iOS app development, signal processing and classification (and great mustache). [Matthew Ha](https://github.com/matthewha123) continued the development of the iOS 
    app and analysis of biosignals for sleep staging.
